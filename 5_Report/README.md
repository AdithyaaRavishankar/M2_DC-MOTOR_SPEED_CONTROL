# OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROJECT 

The main objective of this project is to show that the speed of a dc motor can be changed in many ways wherein in this case a potentiometer is used to control the speed which is considered one of the best and easy method to do so.

# INTRODUCTION

DC motor speed control is one of the most useful features of a motor. By controlling the speed of the motor you can change the speed of the motor as per your requirement and get the required performance.The speed control mechanism is applicable in many cases like controlling the movement of robotic vehicles, movement of motors in paper mills and the movement of motors in elevators where different types of DC motors are used. Speed control of DC motor is one of the most useful features of the motor.

# CATEGORY

Potentiometer is used to change the speed of the dc motor.



# COMPONENTS USED

1.atmega328p 

2.DC Motor

3.Connecting Wires

4.L293 Motor Driver

5.5V Voltage Source

6.Potentiometer

7.Oscope

# ADVANTAGES

1. DC motors offer highly controllable speed.
2. By changing the armature or field voltage it's possible to achieve wide speed variation and with this level of controllability, DC motors offer the precision required by a wide range of industry applications.
3. By controlling the speed of the motor you can change the speed of the motor as per your requirement and get the required performance.
